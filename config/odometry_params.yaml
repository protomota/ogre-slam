# IMPORTANT: Measure actual robot dimensions before using!
#
# To measure:
# 1. wheel_radius: Measure from wheel axle to ground contact point
# 2. wheel_base: Measure distance between front and rear axle centers
# 3. track_width: Measure distance between left and right wheel centers
#
# Note: 2 PPR encoders provide very coarse resolution
# - Consider adding IMU for better orientation estimation
# - robot_localization EKF recommended for sensor fusion
